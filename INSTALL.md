# Installing UDOIT
UDOIT can be installed on your own existing servers with the following instructions. UDOIT is also available as a hosted and maintained product by [Cidi Labs](https://cidilabs.com). UDOIT is built using the [PHP Symfony Framework](https://symfony.com).

## System Requirements
* Apache or Nginx webserver
* PHP 8.1+
* MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL
* Git (If you are using The Git Method below) or if you plan on contributing to UDOIT
* Node v16 is supported; other versions may work
* Yarn

## Source Code
We strongly recommend to manage source code through Git. The benefit of this method is that you can update an existing installation of UDOIT by simply using `git pull`. It also lets you roll back to previous versions if needed. Follow these steps:

* Install Git on your server if necessary. Most Linux distributions preinstall a version of Git. You can verify Git is installed by running `git --version`.
* Navigate to the directory on your server where UDOIT will live
* Run `git clone git@github.com:ucfopen/UDOIT.git .` (The `.` is important. It tells Git to download the files to the current directory.)

## Docker
We provide a fast and simple way of setting up a local UDOIT instance through the use of docker containers. To set up the docker containers, you must first install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Then, simply run the following command from within the UDOIT directory:

    docker-compose up --build

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the php container by calling the command:

    docker exec -it udoit_php_1 /bin/bash

By default the application is set up to create a MySQL database container, but if you wish to create a postgres container instead you can do so by modifying the file `docker-compose.yml`. The credentials required to access this database depend on the database type and can be found in this same file. You can access the database container by calling the command:

    docker exec -it udoit_db_1 /bin/bash

If you ever want to take down the containers, you can do so with the following command:

    docker-compose down

Once you have set up the containers in this way, you will still need to follow the rest of the instructions in this document.

## Configuring your Web Server
The details of configuring a web server with PHP are out of the scope of this README. You should configure your web server to point to UDOIT's "public" folder as the web root folder. Doing this will hide the configuration and source files so that they are not web accessible. It will also clean up your URL structure so that you don't need to include the "public" folder in any of the URLs to UDOIT.

If you are setting up a local UDOIT instance through Docker, you can simplify this step and quickly setup a server by calling the following commands from within the php container:

    docker exec -it udoit_php_1 /bin/bash
    symfony server:ca:install
    symfony serve -d

Security Note:  Do not use the commands above for production installations.  Use software such as [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org) or [NGINX](https://nginx.org).

SSL Issues:  It is important to note that most browsers will automatically block unsigned certificates, and the tool might fail to load with the message that the website might be down or have moved to a new location. If this happens to you after going through the rest of the instructions, you can bypass this warning by opening the specified url in a new tab, granting the browser permission to access the webpage, and then going back to where the UDOIT tool has been integrated and refreshing the page.

> If you are running UDOIT in Docker, you will need do this each time you start the docker container.

## Installing Composer Dependencies
UDOIT uses Composer to install PHP dependencies. If you are using Docker, it will already be installed inside the PHP container. To install the required PHP dependencies, enter the PHP container with:

    docker exec -it udoit_php_1 /bin/bash

Then, install the dependencies:

    composer install --no-dev

If you're not using Docker, follow the upstream documentation on [Composer Installation](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to install `composer.phar` into the project root, then run the following:

    php composer.phar install --no-dev

> Remove the `--no-dev` flag if you wish to use `APP_ENV=dev` below.

## .ENV Setup
UDOIT uses a `.env` file for storing configuration. Local configuration such as database information and URLs should be stored in a `.env.local` file that is NOT tracked in Git.

> These changes should be made outside any of the Docker containers.

1. Copy the file `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`.
```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```
2. Leave `APP_ENV` set to `prod`
> If you are setting up a development environment, set this to `dev` and follow the steps in [Installing Composer Dependencies](#installing-composer-dependencies) without the `--no-dev` flag to obtain all of the development packages.
3. Add your database information to this `DATABASE_URL` variable.
4. Add the `BASE_URL`, which is the full URL to reach the `public` folder of UDOIT. (i.e. https://udoit3.ciditools.com) WITHOUT the trailing slash.
5. Set `APP_LMS` to the name of your LMS.
   * `canvas` if you are using the Canvas LMS.
   * `d2l` if you are using the D2l Brightspace LMS.
6. (Optional) You can change the default language for your entire UDOIT instance by overriding the `DEFAULT_LANG` variable. Currently supported languages are English (`en`) and Spanish (`es`).

## Database Setup
While UDOIT is configured to use MySQL or MariaDB by default, Symfony can be configured to work with other databases as well. See the Symfony documentation for details.

> If you are running UDOIT in Docker, you don't need to install PHP on your system.  You can run 
>
>     docker exec -it udoit_php_1 /bin/bash
>
> and then run the commands below inside the Docker container.

You can create your database manually, or use `Symfony` to create the database with this command:

    php bin/console doctrine:database:create

Once the database is created you can populate the database with the following command:

    php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

Tip: If you are getting errors when running the migration script try the following:

    php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force

If you are operating in a production environment you will need to generate the doctrine proxy classes by running the following command:

    php bin/console cache:warmup --env=prod

## JavaScript
UDOIT uses [node](https://nodejs.org) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to compile the JavaScript. Instructions for installing Node and Yarn are out of the scope of this README.

> If you are running UDOIT in Docker, you don't need to install Node or Yarn on your system. Run 
>
>     docker exec -it udoit_php_1 /bin/bash
>
> and then run the following commands inside the Docker container.

To install the JavaScript dependencies run the command:

    yarn install

To build the JavaScript files for production, run the command:

    yarn build

## Testing Your Setup
Once you have completed the steps above you will want to test your setup. Unfortunately, UDOIT is an LTI tool that can only fully run within the LMS. You will need to complete the steps in the INSTALL_CANVAS.md or INSTALL_D2L.md to test UDOIT fully.

However, UDOIT does have one URL that is publicly available outside of the LMS. To test your server setup point your browser to:

    <BASE_URL>/lti/config

For example, if you are setting this up on your local computer via Docker, it may look like:

    https://localhost:8000/lti/config

## Configuring Your LMS
You will need to complete the steps in the [INSTALL_CANVAS.md](INSTALL_CANVAS.md) or [INSTALL_D2L.md](INSTALL_D2L.md) to configure UDOIT to work within your LMS.
